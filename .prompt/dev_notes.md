Project Overview
Created a multi-page personal portfolio website for Aishwarya Kondaparthi using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Cursor AI assistance. The website showcases professional background, projects, and includes a functional contact form.

Cursor AI Prompts and Outputs

Prompt 1:
Prompt: "Create a responsive navigation bar with logo and menu items for a personal website. Use semantic HTML and CSS for styling. Include active state highlighting and hover effects."

AI Output:
```html
<header>
    <nav>
        <div class="nav-container">
            <div class="logo">
                <h1>Your Name</h1>
            </div>
            <ul class="nav-menu">
                <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
                <li><a href="about.html">About</a></li>
                <li><a href="resume.html">Resume</a></li>
                <li><a href="projects.html">Projects</a></li>

My Contribution: Modified - I accepted the basic structure but customized it significantly:

Changed "Your Name" to "Aishwarya Kondaparthi"

Added active state CSS classes for current page indication

Enhanced CSS with professional color scheme (#2c3e50, #3498db)

Added smooth transitions and hover effects

Implemented responsive design for mobile devices


Prompt 2:
Prompt: "Create a professional hero section for a portfolio website with a personal introduction, subtitle, and call-to-action buttons. Include space for a profile photo."

AI Output:

html
<section class="hero">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="hero-content">
            <div class="hero-text">
                <h1>Your Name</h1>
                <p class="subtitle">Your Professional Title</p>
                <p>Brief introduction about yourself...</p>
                <div class="hero-buttons">
                    <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Primary Action</a>
                    <a href="#" class="btn btn-secondary">Secondary Action</a>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="hero-image">
                <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Profile Photo">
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</section>

My Contribution: Modified - I used the structure but completely rewrote the content and styling:

Changed to personal introduction: "Hi, I'm Aishwarya Kondaparthi ðŸ‘‹"

Updated subtitle to: "Business Analyst | Product Enthusiast | Technology Consultant"

Wrote custom professional introduction paragraphs

Added specific call-to-action buttons: "Contact for Opportunities" and "Connect on LinkedIn"

Implemented gradient background and professional styling

Added image error handling with JavaScript

Prompt 3:
Prompt: "Create a responsive contact form with validation for first name, last name, email, password, confirm password, and message. Include proper accessibility attributes and error messaging."

AI Output:

html
<form id="contactForm">
    <div class="form-group">
        <label for="firstName">First Name</label>
        <input type="text" id="firstName" name="firstName" required>
    </div>
    <div class="form-group">
        <label for="email">Email</label>
        <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>
    </div>
    <!-- More form fields... -->
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

My contribution: Modified - I enhanced the AI's basic form with significant improvements:

Added all required fields per assignment: first name, last name, email, password, confirm password, message

Implemented comprehensive JavaScript validation for:

Password length (min 8 characters)

Password matching

Email format validation

Required field checking

Added proper accessibility attributes: for and id associations

Created custom error messaging system

Added form submission redirect to thank you page

Enhanced CSS styling with focus states and error styles

Reflection:
Using Cursor AI significantly accelerated the development process, particularly for generating boilerplate code and responsive layouts. The AI was most helpful in creating foundational HTML structures and CSS grid systems, which saved me considerable time on repetitive tasks. I used AI in small steps as requiredâ€”first for navigation, then hero section, then form componentsâ€”rather than generating entire solutions.

However, Cursor made several mistakes that required careful debugging. The AI often generated generic placeholder content instead of using my specific information, and sometimes suggested incorrect CSS property values. For example, it initially created a contact form missing the confirm password field required by the assignment. I had to manually add this and implement the validation logic.

I balanced AI assistance by writing all the content myself and maintaining control over the design system. I used AI for scaffolding but implemented custom animations, color schemes, and interactive features manually. The portfolio storytelling in the About Me section was entirely my creation, as AI couldn't capture the personal narrative effectively.

The main trade-off was between development speed and customization. While AI provided quick starting points, each component required significant modification to meet professional standards and assignment requirements. This experience taught me that AI is best used as a collaborative tool for initial scaffolding, with human oversight essential for quality and personalization.

Learning Insights:
AI excels at generating repetitive HTML structures and basic CSS layouts

AI struggles with context-specific content and complex business logic

Best practice is to use AI for scaffolding, then customize extensively

Critical thinking is essential to verify AI suggestions and fix errors

The balance between AI efficiency and human creativity is key to successful development

Technical Trade-offs Considered:
Readability vs Performance: Used CSS animations instead of heavier JavaScript libraries for better performance

Customization vs Speed: Chose to manually write content rather than use AI-generated text for authenticity

Complexity vs Maintainability: Implemented simple form validation instead of complex libraries for easier debugging

Design Consistency vs Innovation: Maintained consistent color scheme while adding unique interactive elements
